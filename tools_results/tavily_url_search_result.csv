https://blog.royallepage.ca/heres-what-we-can-expect-for-greater-montreal-real-estate-prices-in-2024/,"“The real estate crystal ball prediction will be made up of many factors in 2024, but the thing to remember is that the reduction in inflation closer to the target rate will not have been enough to curb the increase in real estate prices for very long, due to a chronic lack of supply,” said Dominic St-Pierre, vice-president and general manager, Royal LePage, Quebec region. Economic conditions in the province were heavily weighed down at the end of the year by the outbreak of strikes in the public sector, as well as numerous layoffs across a myriad of industries, which could influence consumer confidence regarding large purchases such as a property in 2024, despite a widely expected drop in interest rates.

https://www.marioconte.com/en/montreal-real-estate-2024-essential-market-insights-and-predictions/,"Many experts believe that the central bank will maintain the interest rate at around 5% for the first half of 2024, and might start reducing it in the latter half of the year.
 Predictions for Property Transactions
The number of houses and condos changing hands in the Montreal area is predicted to drop by about 3% next year, a smaller decline compared to the 15% decrease estimated for 2023. However, the overall number of home sales is expected to decrease for the fourth year in a row, mainly due to the impact of high interest rates.
 Additionally, factors like strong migration flows and hopes for an economic rebound should support the demand for homes.
Insights from Industry Experts
Marc Lefrançois, a broker with Royal LePage, notes that the limited availability of housing in Greater Montreal continues to be a challenge. These include the expectation of a gradual decrease in interest rates starting sometime in 2024 and a slight rise in unemployment in the province, expected to reach around 5.3% on average.
