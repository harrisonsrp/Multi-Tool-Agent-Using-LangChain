            "Published on March 26, 2024",
            "Many people are keeping a close eye on the Montreal housing market now that 2024 is in full swing. Will it be easier for buyers to acquire a property? Will it remain a sellers\u2019 market? How interest rates evolve will shed a lot of light on these questions and determine the trends to watch in the coming months.",
            "Here is what you need to know about housing activity, market conditions and Montreal housing prices.",
            "Summary:",
            "Montreal keeps its status as an affordable Canadian city compared to other metropolitan areas like Toronto and Vancouver, and the market appears to be holding stable. However, demand continues to outpace supply in many neighbourhoods as residential construction experienced a sharp slowdown in the first six months of 2023.1",
            "Desjardins expects housing prices and sales to remain relatively stable in the first half of 2024. The affordability factor remains a top challenge at this time given the housing supply shortage and high mortgage rates. Sales are expected to pick up slightly at mid-year with a helpful boost from some key rate cuts. Prices should also keep rising but we are not expecting any surge like we witnessed during the pandemic.",
            "The municipal administration is throwing its support behind affordable housing construction. However, rising land and material costs combined with high interest rates are proving to be major stumbling blocks to achieving that goal. The housing shortage has resulted in increased rental prices, which in turn has pushed many renters to look into buying instead. Less expensive homes are often located in outlying areas so many potential buyers are considering the condo route as a way to stay centrally located.",
            "\u201cGiven the current challenges, the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation's target of 3.5 million units by 2030 seems unrealistic to us. Securing new construction to match needs is also important. For example, building housing for students and retirees could free up existing housing for families,\u201d stated Jimmy Jean, Vice President, Chief Economist and Strategist at Desjardins Group.",
            "The city is still popular among young professionals, students and immigrants. This sustained demand, combined with a low number of active listings,2 has put pressure on the market and encouraged prices to rise.",
            "Government policies seem to have not had the desired impact, including measures aimed to curb real estate speculation. There has also been a limited impact noted as a result of the ban on non-Canadians buying real estate. It is worthwhile to note that the diversity of Montreal neighbourhoods plays a vital role in price variations. The highly sought after Plateau-Mont-Royal neighbourhood, known to be home to many local businesses, recorded an increase in sale prices.3",
            "The real estate market is affected by changes to the Bank of Canada's key interest rate. When the rate goes up, so do mortgage interest rates, and that makes it more expensive to borrow. An increased rate can lower demand and make it harder to get a loan, which slows down real estate activity. Conversely, lower mortgage rates result in more advantageous loans that encourage people to invest in real estate, which can lead to increased demand and higher prices.",
            "Learn about current mortgage rates at Desjardins",
            "In addition, the key interest rate influences the number of housing starts that get under way due to its impact on financing costs. Lower rates motivate property developers to borrow to fund projects and this stimulates construction activity. Low interest rates can boost investor confidence and create favourable economic conditions for residential construction.",
            "The Bank of Canada\u2019s key interest rate remained high throughout the year, rising from 4.5% in January 2023 to 5% in July 2023. We cannot underestimate the impact this has had on monthly budgets for mortgage payments. It has forced a significant number of potential homebuyers to shelve their plans and wait for the rate to drop.",
            "Variations in key interest rate",
            "The good news is many economists predict the key interest rate will drop by the end of 2024, which could cause a domino effect on interest rates to fall in the future. It is interesting to note that the Bank of Canada has not yet commented publicly about a looming interest rate cut. It is currently seeking further confirmation that inflation is indeed heading for 2%.",
            "The Bank of Canada\u2019s overnight rate should be standardized this spring. Desjardins expects the Bank of Canada to make five cuts of 0.25% each, which will drop the key interest rate from its current 5% to 3.75% by the end of the year. Interest rates will understandably be higher than the overnight rate but should generally follow this trend and that will help some households qualify to buy a property. However, prices will remain buoyant due to an underwhelming supply and that means the affordability factor will not see much improvement. A lower rate will incite a mild resurgence in housing starts but structural constraints will deprive the market of a full-fledged rebound.",
            "\u201cWe believe the Bank of Canada key interest rate will start to fall around June. However, mortgage rates will not go down by a lot or that fast. Anyone renewing their mortgage should still expect high payments,\u201d warns Mr. Jean.",
            "Property prices are also influenced by the local economy in Montreal. Factors like job growth and household income are major drivers of real estate demand. If the local economy is strong, it can stimulate housing demand and put upward pressure on prices.",
            "Population growth can trigger increased housing demand, which can lead to higher house prices. Positive perceptions can encourage buying while economic uncertainty can have the opposite effect.",
            "Here are statistics on property sales for the various types of residential property in the metropolitan area.",
            "The median price of single-family homes in Montreal increased throughout 2023. The median price was $656,500 from January to June 2023, compared to $725,000 for the last six months of the year.2 The volume of sales of single-family homes also rose, moving from 1,901 real estate transactions in the first half to 2,145 in the second.3",
            "The median price of condominiums in Montreal remained stable. The median price was $441,226 from January to June 2023, compared to $442,000 for the last six months of the year.2 The volume of sales of condominiums, much higher than single-family homes, moved from 5,289 units in the first half to 5,348 in the second.3",
            "The median price of 2 to 5-unit income properties in Montreal rose throughout 2023. The median price was $750,000 from January to June 2023, compared to $770,000 for the last six months of the year.2 The volume of sales of plexes also increased, moving from 1,193 in the first half to 1,407 in the second.3",
            "The price of Montreal properties varies widely depending on the neighbourhood. Prices in central areas tend to be higher due to the proximity to businesses, entertainment and metro stations. More affordable options can be found in outlying areas, reflecting the diversity of the Montreal housing market.",

            "Many people are keeping a close eye on the Montreal housing market now that 2024 is in full swing. Will it be easier for buyers to acquire a property? Will it remain a sellers\u2019 market? How interest rates evolve will shed a lot of light on these questions and determine the trends to watch in the coming months.",
            "Here is what you need to know about housing activity, market conditions and Montreal housing prices.",
            "Summary:",
            "Montreal keeps its status as an affordable Canadian city compared to other metropolitan areas like Toronto and Vancouver, and the market appears to be holding stable. However, demand continues to outpace supply in many neighbourhoods as residential construction experienced a sharp slowdown in the first six months of 2023.1",
            "Desjardins expects housing prices and sales to remain relatively stable in the first half of 2024. The affordability factor remains a top challenge at this time given the housing supply shortage and high mortgage rates. Sales are expected to pick up slightly at mid-year with a helpful boost from some key rate cuts. Prices should also keep rising but we are not expecting any surge like we witnessed during the pandemic.",
            "The municipal administration is throwing its support behind affordable housing construction. However, rising land and material costs combined with high interest rates are proving to be major stumbling blocks to achieving that goal. The housing shortage has resulted in increased rental prices, which in turn has pushed many renters to look into buying instead. Less expensive homes are often located in outlying areas so many potential buyers are considering the condo route as a way to stay centrally located.",
            "\u201cGiven the current challenges, the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation's target of 3.5 million units by 2030 seems unrealistic to us. Securing new construction to match needs is also important. For example, building housing for students and retirees could free up existing housing for families,\u201d stated Jimmy Jean, Vice President, Chief Economist and Strategist at Desjardins Group.",
            "The city is still popular among young professionals, students and immigrants. This sustained demand, combined with a low number of active listings,2 has put pressure on the market and encouraged prices to rise.",
            "Government policies seem to have not had the desired impact, including measures aimed to curb real estate speculation. There has also been a limited impact noted as a result of the ban on non-Canadians buying real estate. It is worthwhile to note that the diversity of Montreal neighbourhoods plays a vital role in price variations. The highly sought after Plateau-Mont-Royal neighbourhood, known to be home to many local businesses, recorded an increase in sale prices.3",
            "The real estate market is affected by changes to the Bank of Canada's key interest rate. When the rate goes up, so do mortgage interest rates, and that makes it more expensive to borrow. An increased rate can lower demand and make it harder to get a loan, which slows down real estate activity. Conversely, lower mortgage rates result in more advantageous loans that encourage people to invest in real estate, which can lead to increased demand and higher prices.",
            "Learn about current mortgage rates at Desjardins",
            "In addition, the key interest rate influences the number of housing starts that get under way due to its impact on financing costs. Lower rates motivate property developers to borrow to fund projects and this stimulates construction activity. Low interest rates can boost investor confidence and create favourable economic conditions for residential construction.",
            "The Bank of Canada\u2019s key interest rate remained high throughout the year, rising from 4.5% in January 2023 to 5% in July 2023. We cannot underestimate the impact this has had on monthly budgets for mortgage payments. It has forced a significant number of potential homebuyers to shelve their plans and wait for the rate to drop.",
            "Variations in key interest rate",
            "The good news is many economists predict the key interest rate will drop by the end of 2024, which could cause a domino effect on interest rates to fall in the future. It is interesting to note that the Bank of Canada has not yet commented publicly about a looming interest rate cut. It is currently seeking further confirmation that inflation is indeed heading for 2%.",
            "The Bank of Canada\u2019s overnight rate should be standardized this spring. Desjardins expects the Bank of Canada to make five cuts of 0.25% each, which will drop the key interest rate from its current 5% to 3.75% by the end of the year. Interest rates will understandably be higher than the overnight rate but should generally follow this trend and that will help some households qualify to buy a property. However, prices will remain buoyant due to an underwhelming supply and that means the affordability factor will not see much improvement. A lower rate will incite a mild resurgence in housing starts but structural constraints will deprive the market of a full-fledged rebound.",
            "\u201cWe believe the Bank of Canada key interest rate will start to fall around June. However, mortgage rates will not go down by a lot or that fast. Anyone renewing their mortgage should still expect high payments,\u201d warns Mr. Jean.",
            "Property prices are also influenced by the local economy in Montreal. Factors like job growth and household income are major drivers of real estate demand. If the local economy is strong, it can stimulate housing demand and put upward pressure on prices.",
            "Population growth can trigger increased housing demand, which can lead to higher house prices. Positive perceptions can encourage buying while economic uncertainty can have the opposite effect.",
            "Here are statistics on property sales for the various types of residential property in the metropolitan area.",
            "The median price of single-family homes in Montreal increased throughout 2023. The median price was $656,500 from January to June 2023, compared to $725,000 for the last six months of the year.2 The volume of sales of single-family homes also rose, moving from 1,901 real estate transactions in the first half to 2,145 in the second.3",
            "The median price of condominiums in Montreal remained stable. The median price was $441,226 from January to June 2023, compared to $442,000 for the last six months of the year.2 The volume of sales of condominiums, much higher than single-family homes, moved from 5,289 units in the first half to 5,348 in the second.3",
            "The median price of 2 to 5-unit income properties in Montreal rose throughout 2023. The median price was $750,000 from January to June 2023, compared to $770,000 for the last six months of the year.2 The volume of sales of plexes also increased, moving from 1,193 in the first half to 1,407 in the second.3",
            "The price of Montreal properties varies widely depending on the neighbourhood. Prices in central areas tend to be higher due to the proximity to businesses, entertainment and metro stations. More affordable options can be found in outlying areas, reflecting the diversity of the Montreal housing market.",

All regions, with the exception of the South Shore, recorded a quarterly decline, reflecting buyer fatigue in the face of higher mortgage rates, heavily affecting buyers\u2019 purchasing power throughout the year.",
            "In the fourth quarter of 2023, the aggregate[1] price of a property in the Greater Montreal Area rose 4.1% compared to the same quarter in 2022 to reach $566,700, down 1.5% on a quarterly basis. However, a comparison of the price of a property in the fourth quarter of 2023 with the same period in 2019 reveals a 30.6% increase in property values in the region.",
            "When broken out by property type, the median price of a single-family detached home rose 4.7% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 to reach $629,700, posting a quarterly decrease of 2.5%. The median price of a standard condominium remained stable in the fourth quarter of 2023, up 1.1% compared to the same period in 2022, and rose 0.1% between the second and third quarters to $450,200. Price data, which includes both resale and new build, is provided by Royal LePage\u2019s sister company RPS Real Property Solutions, a leading Canadian real estate valuation company.",
            "\u201cThe last quarter of the year saw a slight decline in prices and sales in the Greater Montreal Area real estate market as a direct result of inflation and the significant increase in mortgage rates in 2023,\u201d said Dominic St-Pierre, vice president and general manager, Royal LePage, Quebec Region. \u201cDespite this, we are seeing an increase in requests for showings, which reflects renewed optimism among buyers about the real estate market, while a drop in interest rates seems increasingly within their reach for 2024.\u201d",
            "Experts widely expect the Bank of Canada to start cutting its overnight lending rate in 2024, if Consumer Price Index (CPI) data continues to follow a downward trajectory. Inflation reached 3.1% in Canada (3.6% in Quebec) in November, compared to the same month in 2022, while the housing segment included in the CPI rose by 5.9% over the same period (6.8% in Quebec).[2]",
            "\u201cThe Bank of Canada\u2019s campaign to reduce inflation has proved very effective,\u201d said St-Pierre, pointing out that inflation reached 8.1% in June 2022. \u201cHowever, the final stretch towards the central bank\u2019s objective could be more complex than we had hoped. The employment rate remains very resilient, which means that household spending could remain high and continue to stimulate the economy,\u201d added St-Pierre, arguing that the central bank will remain cautious to ensure that it does not stimulate inflation further while trying to ease the cost of living for Canadian households.",
            "\u201cOn the other hand, the weight of housing in the calculation of inflation is very important,\u201d added St-Pierre. \u201cIf we were to remove mortgage interest costs from the CPI calculation, the inflation rate would already be well below the Bank of Canada\u2019s upper target of 3%.\u201d",
            "A look at the state of the Greater Montreal Area property market shows that the number of active listings for all property types remains well below the ten-year average, and this is despite strong growth in demand due to rapid population growth. In December 2014, there were a total of 30,171 active residential listings in the Montreal Metropolitan Area, compared with 15,907 in December 2023, or 47.3% below the average for the last decade[3].",
            "\u201cEven though consumers have adapted to the new reality of higher mortgage rates, increased borrowing costs are the main factor currently keeping prices from escalating, given that the supply of housing remains extremely low. We expect pent-up demand to show up quickly in the housing market, as soon as the central bank announces a change of course in its monetary policy,\u201d said St-Pierre. \u201cThe spring market should be dynamic.\u201d",
            "According to St-Pierre, the slowdown, or even stoppage, of a number of housing projects in 2023 due to builders\u2019 financing costs has exacerbated the housing shortage. He predicts that it will take a long time to catch up, given the growing demand for condominiums from first-time buyers, immigrants and baby boomers. \u201cMore and more baby boomers will want to reduce their living space and cut back on maintenance.\u201d",
            "In addition to buyers who had been pushed out of the resale market due to their limited purchasing power, experienced buyers who were able to wait for more favourable conditions will also be coming back at the same time, likely in more expensive property segments. It is therefore expected that all property types will see an increase in value, albeit moderate, in 2024.",
            "St-Pierre expects a slow start to the year in terms of sales, with a strong uptick in activity towards the end of spring, spurred by the anticipated drop in borrowing costs, as predicted in the recent Royal LePage 2024 Market Survey Forecast published in December.",
            "Provincial picture",
            "Across Quebec, the vast majority of markets in the report ended 2023 with increases compared to year-end 2022, in all property segments, while most regions saw slight quarterly declines, reflecting the effects of higher borrowing costs on households. With the exception of Sherbrooke, the regional markets outside the Greater Montreal Area all recorded slight increases quarter over quarter in the aggregate price, where the impact of higher interest rates has been more muted given the relative affordability of homes in these areas. The Quebec City and Trois-Rivi\u00e8res markets are the only ones to have experienced no quarterly decline in property prices throughout 2023.",
            "Provided that the Bank of Canada begins cutting its overnight lending rate in 2024, as expected by many experts, this year should see a return of pent-up buyer demand to the market. This, in addition to a chronic housing shortage, will drive property prices higher. Quebec still faces a shortfall of between 860,000 and almost 1,090,000 homes needed by 2030, according to calculations by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), based on population growth scenarios and residential construction projections.[4]",

            "6 min. read",
            "With 2023 drawing to a close, many households are now writing their wish lists for the coming year, and are identifying their future priorities and needs. The purchase of a first or new property will certainly be on many people\u2019s wish lists next year, particularly as a decrease in interest rates is widely expected to occur in the second half of 2024. However, lower real estate prices \u2014 which many buyers who have been priced out of the market by higher borrowing costs are waiting for \u2014 may not be on the cards for the year ahead.",
            "According to Royal LePage, the aggregate price of a home in the Greater Montreal Area is forecast to increase 5.0 per cent year over year to $610,260 in the fourth quarter of 2024. During the same period, the median price of a single-family detached property is expected to rise 4.5 per cent to $684,998, while the median price of a condominium is forecast to increase 6.0 per cent to $471,912.",
            "\u201cThe real estate crystal ball prediction will be made up of many factors in 2024, but the thing to remember is that the reduction in inflation closer to the target rate will not have been enough to curb the increase in real estate prices for very long, due to a chronic lack of supply,\u201d said Dominic St-Pierre, vice-president and general manager, Royal LePage, Quebec region. \u201cHousing is an essential need, and the still-critical shortage of units required to meet demand and population growth is destined to persist, as long as investments by all levels of government fail to materialize in the urban landscape. However, even if interest rates are expected to start dipping next year, consumers will have to adapt to a new reality, as the days of ultra-low rates are over. In the short term, this should keep property price increases in check while households adjust their purchasing behaviours.\u201d",
            "What\u2019s more, Montreal is the Canadian city where housing starts fell the most in the first six months of 2023, a 26-year record, and the prognosis for 2024 is not optimal. Rising borrowing costs have taken a heavy toll on builders\u2019 and developers\u2019 portfolios over the past year. For this reason, it is expected that when interest rates start to decline, the pent-up demand will unleash on the condominium segment in the Greater Montreal Area, which will see an appreciation rate slightly higher than that of single-family homes.",
            "\u201cIn addition to condominiums, the market for single-family homes priced at $1 million and higher should also see an upturn as expectations of lower interest rates materialize,\u201d said Marc Lefran\u00e7ois, chartered real estate broker, Royal LePage Tendance in Montreal. \u201cFor this category of buyers, moving from one property to another is often not an immediate necessity. Many have therefore preferred to wait in order to take advantage of more favourable financing conditions, but could return to the market quickly when the central bank announces the start of a downward cycle in interest rates.\u201d",
            "Economic conditions in the province were heavily weighed down at the end of the year by the outbreak of strikes in the public sector, as well as numerous layoffs across a myriad of industries, which could influence consumer confidence regarding large purchases such as a property in 2024, despite a widely expected drop in interest rates.",
            "\u201cSavings accumulated by households during the pandemic have begun to run out, keeping pace with inflation and interest rate hikes over the past 21 months,\u201d noted St-Pierre. \u201cQuebec households have a high level of debt, and despite signs of relief in borrowing costs on the horizon, their purchasing power will remain limited. The downward adjustment of the Bank of Canada\u2019s overnight rate, even by a quarter per cent, could send a strong message to consumers about future economic conditions. The pace at which interest rates rebalance will also play a big part in the equation,\u201d he continued.",
            "St-Pierre added, \u201cThe start of 2024 could see the Greater Montreal Area\u2019s real estate market get off to a slow start, following a similar trend to the last quarter of 2023. But, we expect the recovery to get underway quickly once interest rates start to fall. Next year is likely to be more active than 2023 in terms of property sales,\u201d he concluded.",

            "In 2024, the real estate scene in Greater Montreal is set to follow a familiar pattern, with a slight uptick in prices for homes and condos. However, the overall number of home sales is expected to decrease for the fourth year in a row, mainly due to the impact of high interest rates.",
            "Predictions for Property Transactions",
            "The number of houses and condos changing hands in the Montreal area is predicted to drop by about 3% next year, a smaller decline compared to the 15% decrease estimated for 2023. This forecast comes from the Quebec Professional Association of Real Estate Brokers (QPAREB).",
            "Price Trends for Homes and Condos",
            "Despite the downturn in sales, there's a silver lining. The median prices for both single-family homes and condos are likely to see a small rise in 2024, reversing the modest drops experienced this year.",
            "Interest Rates and the Real Estate Market",
            "The past couple of years have seen multiple interest rate hikes by the Bank of Canada, which has cooled off the real estate market, not just in Montreal but across various regions. However, the future looks a bit brighter. Many experts believe that the central bank will maintain the interest rate at around 5% for the first half of 2024, and might start reducing it in the latter half of the year.",
            "2024: A Year of Two Phases",
            "St\u00e9phanie Lapierre, the chief economist at QPAREB, suggests that 2024 might be a year of two distinct phases. The beginning of the year might be challenging due to economic uncertainties and high interest rates. However, the latter half of the year is expected to see an upturn, with a potential increase in property prices, mainly because the number of available properties remains low.",
            "Sales Forecast in Detail",
            "QPAREB estimates that about 35,230 residential real estate transactions will take place in metropolitan Montreal next year, a slight decrease from this year's predicted 36,285. Notably, home sales in the area have been declining annually since 2021.",
            "Province-Wide Trends",
            "Across Quebec, residential property sales are expected to fall by 2% next year. Interestingly, the median prices for single-family homes across the province are likely to remain relatively stable.",
            "Market Stabilization on the Horizon",
            "2024 is anticipated to be a pivotal year for the real estate resale market, marking the beginning of its stabilization.",
            "Factors Influencing the Forecast",
            "Several key factors have been considered in QPAREB\u2019s forecast. These include the expectation of a gradual decrease in interest rates starting sometime in 2024 and a slight rise in unemployment in the province, expected to reach around 5.3% on average.",
            "The Early 2024 Market Scenario",
            "With a slowing economy, increasing joblessness, and continued high property prices, the beginning of 2024 might see a dip in home sales. This scenario could lead to more listings on the market, giving buyers more leverage to negotiate better deals.",
            "A Shift Later in the Year",
            "Despite the initial slump, the market is expected to rebound later in the year. Charles Brant from QPAREB predicts a swift response to any announcements of rate cuts, leading to a more robust market recovery. Additionally, factors like strong migration flows and hopes for an economic rebound should support the demand for homes.",
            "Insights from Industry Experts",
            "Marc Lefran\u00e7ois, a broker with Royal LePage, notes that the limited availability of housing in Greater Montreal continues to be a challenge. This supply-demand imbalance is expected to keep pushing the market upwards.",
            "Price Projections for Montreal",
            "In Greater Montreal, despite relatively low activity levels, prices have remained stable. QPAREB forecasts a 2% increase in median prices for single-family homes and a 1% rise for condos next year. Specifically, the median price of a single-family home is expected to reach approximately $549,400 by the end of 2024, up from the current estimate of $539,800. For condos, the median price is projected to hit around $395,600, up from $390,200.",
            "Royal LePage's More Optimistic Forecast",
            "In contrast, Royal LePage presents a more optimistic view for 2024. They predict a 5% year-over-year increase in aggregate home prices in Greater Montreal by the fourth quarter of 2024, reaching $610,260. This includes a 4.5% rise for single-family detached properties to $684,998 and a 6% increase for condos to $471,912. These figures are based on a weighted average of median values for all housing types, including both resale and newly-built homes.",

            "Looking ahead to 2023 and the first month of 2024, initial analyses are encouraging for the current year, which should end with a growing market after an uncertain first half.",
            "Prices are also expected to rise, and there are a number of different types of players on the market who should play a major role in the expected growth. Finally, we\u2019ll try to answer questions about whether the real estate market will rise or fall in 2024.",
            "Halfway through the year, the real estate market has exceeded expectations. With economic conditions becoming more flexible and market players increasingly confident, we\u2019ve been seeing significant growth in the market for several months now.",
            "Let\u2019s take a closer look at these topics.",
            "The year 2024 is shaping up to be a period of great importance for the Montreal real estate market, with forecasts indicating a year of contrasts, marked by a first half marked by major challenges and a second half that promises renewed activity and dynamism. In view of this early analysis, we can say that the market has surprised everyone, with growth statistics still on target.",
            "Experts, such as the Association professionnelle des courtiers immobiliers du Qu\u00e9bec (APCIQ), anticipate a moderate 2% decrease in the number of transactions, in stark contrast to the 33% drop from the record levels of 2022 (Andr\u00e9 Duluc, La presse). This relative slowdown testifies to the market\u2019s resilience in the face of economic fluctuations and changes in interest rates.",
            "The expected stability of prices, remaining at end-2023 levels of $411,300, is particularly remarkable given the spectacular 39% growth observed since 2020. This trend suggests an absorption of recent economic impacts and an adaptation of the market to prevailing conditions. The year 2024 could therefore be characterized by a market correction and consolidation, following years of sustained growth. Paradoxically, the statistics observed since the beginning of the year nevertheless show good vitality and growth in the market.",
            "Interest rates, which are likely to remain high in the first half of the year, will play a crucial role in the initial slowdown in transactions. However, anticipated monetary easing could catalyze a recovery in real estate activity in the second half of the year, offering opportunities for both buyers and sellers. This dynamic highlights the market\u2019s sensitivity to monetary policies and central bank decisions.",
            "In this context, the Montreal market stands out for its specific behaviors. In Montreal, where the market remains largely in favor of sellers, a slight rise in prices is forecast, underlining the city\u2019s continuing demand and economic vitality.",
            "At the same time, immigration, with a significant number of new arrivals in 2023, will continue to have a positive influence on property demand, partially offsetting the effects of limited new construction. These new residents, looking for homes to buy, are injecting new energy into the resale market, exacerbated by rising wages and an unemployment rate that is expected to remain low.On the other hand, this dynamic remains contrasted by an insufficient level of house and condo construction, pushing buyers towards the resale market. Lastly, positive wage trends and an unemployment rate that is set to remain low are helping to maintain solid demand.",
            "In this landscape, risk factors such as the post-pandemic return to the office and affordability concerns for first-time buyers remain paramount. These factors will require continued vigilance on the part of market players to successfully navigate a changing environment. However, with the dynamics observed and the new market players, the sector\u2019s momentum remains positive for the year ahead.",

            "Experts, including those at the Association professionnelle des courtiers immobiliers du Qu\u00e9bec (APCIQ), predict that property prices will remain at the levels observed at the end of 2023, i.e. around $411,300.",
            "This forecast reflects remarkable price stability, despite significant economic challenges, and stands in stark contrast to the meteoric rise of 39% between 2020 and today.",
            "This price consistency is all the more significant as it comes after a period of strong growth, illustrating the resilience of the real estate market in the face of interest rate variations and economic uncertainties.",
            "The fact that prices are holding up suggests that, despite a potentially slower start to the year due to high interest rates, an upturn in activity is expected in the second half of the year, thanks to anticipated monetary easing. In a specific market such as Montreal, a slight increase in prices is forecast, with houses and condos likely to see their median prices rise by 2% and 1% respectively, reflecting strong demand and the metropolis\u2019 continuing attractiveness.",
            "In conclusion, forecasts for 2024 suggest a balanced and resilient real estate market, capable of adapting to economic challenges while offering attractive buying opportunities.",

            "Here\u2019s a look at the key players in the real estate market in 2024.",
            "In 2024, the role of investors and timeshare owners will remain predominant, particularly in downtown Montreal, where their presence is particularly strong.",
            "Representing over 16% of home buyers in Montreal in 2021, this category of investors continues to have a significant impact on the market, particularly in terms of the availability and price of residential properties. Their influence can also be seen in their ownership of a significant share of the housing stock, exacerbating affordability issues for first-time buyers.",
            "For first-time buyers, access to property ownership in Montreal remains fraught with difficulties, due in part to high property tax rates compared to other major Canadian cities. Financial hurdles, such as the stress test and interest rates kept high by the Bank of Canada, make  buying a first home particularly difficult without external financial support.  This situation calls for additional measures to improve affordability and facilitate access to home ownership for new entrants to the market.",
            "Affordability challenges, exacerbated by high interest rates and rising prices, are forcing these buyers to look for creative solutions to realize their real estate dreams. Help-to-buy programs, such as the first-time buyer incentive, play a crucial role, although their effectiveness is limited by persistent financial barriers.",
            "Immigration and out-of-province migration to Montreal continue to shape demand in the real estate market. With the federal government planning to welcome 2 million new immigrants to Canada, Montreal, with its cultural and economic appeal, is attracting a significant share of these new arrivals. This dynamic trend supports demand for both rental and purchase properties, contributing to the vitality and diversity of the local real estate market.",
            "With over 109,000 new residents in the first half of 2023, immigration continues to support demand for homes. These new arrivals, with a purchase probability of over 50% for 3 out of 10 of them, play a crucial role in maintaining activity on the resale market, offsetting the slowdown in new construction.",
            "In short, the year 2024 will see a complex interplay between different players in the Montreal real estate market. Understanding their respective influence and the challenges they face is essential to effectively navigating the city\u2019s real estate landscape.",
            "The dynamics of the real estate market in 2024 are complex and influenced by multiple factors, from global economic trends to specific local policies.",
            "Based on available information and expert forecasts, here\u2019s how we can anticipate real estate price trends.",
            "The question of the real estate market\u2019s decline in 2024 is nuanced and needs to be viewed through the prism of several key factors. Initially, it is essential to recognize that the market may be subject to varying pressures over the course of the year, directly influencing supply and demand dynamics.",
            "Among the specific factors influencing these dynamics, we identify :",
            "This moderate increase in new construction, combined with short-term rental regulations and mortgage renewals, could have a significant impact on supply and demand.",
            "To answer the question of how real estate prices will evolve in Montreal in 2024, it\u2019s important to note that the real estate market, particularly in urban areas like Montreal, is influenced by a multitude of factors.",
            "These factors include macroeconomic trends, monetary policies (notably interest rates), housing demand, available supply and region-specific dynamics.",
            "According to Royal LePage, a significant increase in prices is expected in 2024, with growth of 5% to 6% for single-family properties and condos in Montreal, reflecting a recovery in the market after a quieter period.",
            "At the same time, Soumissions Courtiers Immobiliers forecasts suggest a slight increase in prices due to an anticipated fall in interest rates and an overall economic recovery. They also indicate that price rises may not be uniform across all regions, underlining the importance of location in price dynamics.",
            "We agree with this analysis of a likely future price increase in the Montreal area. While there are significant risks to the market, market conditions, its proven resilience and Montreal\u2019s attractiveness remain factors that should lead to higher prices.",
            "One of the driving forces behind Montreal\u2019s real estate success is the constant demand for housing. The city\u2019s diverse neighborhoods, rich cultural diversity and thriving job market continue to attract a wide range of buyers. However, the challenge lies in meeting this demand with an adequate supply of housing.",
            "In February 2024, the city is witnessing a balanced market, with a slight inclination towards a seller\u2019s market in certain neighborhoods. Low inventory levels have led to heightened competition between buyers, making it crucial for future owners to act decisively and be prepared for potential bidding wars.",
            "By 2024, many factors, including demographic changes, technological developments and government policies, will shape the types of properties in demand and real estate trends in the metropolis.",
            "Condominiums, single-family homes and duplexes remain popular choices among buyers. In recent months, there has been growing interest in sustainable and energy-efficient homes, reflecting a broader global trend towards ecologically conscious living.",
            "Buyers are also showing a preference for properties with outdoor spaces, such as balconies or gardens, given that the importance of outdoor living spaces has been underlined by recent world events. Homes with dedicated office space remain popular, as remote working arrangements persist in many industries.",
            "With the ever-increasing urban population and the search for affordable housing, condominiums and apartments remain popular choices, especially for first-time buyers and investors. The trend towards smaller, more efficient living spaces continues, as buyers prioritize location and convenience over large living spaces.",
            "Although the market for single-family homes remains strong, demand for these properties could be influenced by interest rates and credit availability. Families looking for more space and a quieter environment may prefer Montreal\u2019s suburbs and suburban areas.",
            "A growing awareness of environmental issues is prompting buyers to favor energy-efficient properties. New buildings tend to incorporate green technologies, such as solar panels, geothermal heating systems and sustainable building materials.",
            "The integration of technology into residential properties continues to grow in popularity. Buyers are looking for homes equipped with home automation systems for security, comfort and energy efficiency.",
            "The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the trend towards multifunctional homes that can accommodate telecommuting, distance learning and leisure activities. Buyers are looking for properties offering home offices, leisure space and gardens.",

            "The Nouvel Outremont project is an emblematic example, marking the transformation of a former Canadian Pacific rail yard into a vibrant space including the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al MIL Campus, over 1,300 housing units (30% of which are social and community housing), and the creation of new public spaces.",
            "This indicates a strong commitment to housing diversification and improving residents\u2019 quality of life. The completion of Avenue Th\u00e9r\u00e8se-Lavoie-Roux, scheduled for 2020, is another example of this, highlighting the introduction of soft mobility infrastructure such as bicycle lanes.",
            "The Griffintown area is particularly representative of this transformation, with large-scale real estate projects reinventing the urban landscape while drawing inspiration from the neighborhood\u2019s rich historical heritage. The revitalization of rue Sainte-Catherine Ouest also illustrates this dynamic, offering one of the most dynamic commercial spaces in the world while improving public space for pedestrians.",
            "These projects are just a few examples of initiatives to improve the housing supply and quality of life in Montreal. They reflect an ambitious vision of the future, in which urban planning and sustainable development are central concerns. These efforts are likely to attract more residents and investors to these booming neighborhoods, contributing to sustained demand in the real estate market.",
